# ATAKRR: ATAK Radio Reconaissance

I'm currently working on building a team to put together an AI/ML RF identification project that's primarily intended for the military, but may also have civilian purposes for WISPs, search and rescue, fire and police.  It aims to be a low-SWaP solution to create hyperspectral RF awareness.

##  What does ATAKRR do?

ATAKRR scans the airwaves, collecting information on seen signals and classifying them using AI/ML.  It also aims to eventually do device fingerprinting.  I envision ATAKRR as evolving into a comprehensive suite of tools to allow spectral fusion (a term I prefer to "domination") whereby we have total awareness of the events happening around us on the RF spectrum, they're displayed in an easy-to-understand fashion, and information is also logged for later analysis and tuning of the AI/ML portion of the project.

Furthermore, I would like to have a distributed database of signals that are uploaded by users, tagged, and used to fine-tune the AI/ML engine, as real-world data is paramount to getting reliable, resilient functioning.  The way this would work is there would be a centralized database where unknown signals could be sent.  They would then be analyzed and tagged by sigint specialists and this information would be used to update the AI/ML engine.

##  What does ATAKRR look like?

It's still in the idea stage, but I'm planning on taking the information and overlaying it on a map using ATAK.  This will give you awareness of the RF environment around you.  You can find out about people by tracking their bluetooth signals, or voice and cellular radio.  You can find and track drones.  You can fingerprint devices and optionally associate them with groups or individuals (ie "this is an Al-Qaeda drone" or "these are civilians" or "this is the phone we've seen here").  You can get the information on devices seen in an area, at a time, by device, by manufacturer, by device type, by signal type, etc.

## Why ATAKRR?

We're surrounded by an invisible sea of signals that convey as much, or more, information than our eyes and ears.  If we make this "visible" to us, we become hyper-aware of the events surrounding us, giving us fusion (the union of elements - of our perception and the RF signals surrounding us).  In the future, this could also be integrated into AR/VR devices, giving us information about the people surrounding us and their capabilities and even alerting us to hidden friends who might be lurking behind shrubberies nearby.
